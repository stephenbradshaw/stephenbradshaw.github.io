BackTrack 4 Final has finally been released!<br/><br/>Along with the new BackTrack version there is also a new <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/">website</a> including various installation, customisation and usage HowTo documents, a new <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/blog/">blog</a>, and a new <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/forums/">forum</a>.<br/><br/>I am currently downloading BT4 Final from the official torrent (the official downloads are <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/downloads/">here</a>, dont forget to check the MD5 hash!) , and I will post here again with my first impressions once the download is complete and I have had a chance to look at things.<br/><br/>The new versions of backTrack apparently contains an expanded toolset, lots of bugfixes from the Beta and PreFinal releases, and some custom tools which I am looking forward to checking out.Â  BackTrack 4 Final also appears to still use a custom repository for software installation, which should make it more suitable to use as an everyday Linux system - Im wondering if there is now some automated update tool included.<br/><br/>Should be interesting...
