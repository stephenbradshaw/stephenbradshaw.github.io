After a long period of persistently avoiding social media, I have now moved (somewhat) into the Web 2.0 age and am now on Twitter, where I semi-regularly dispense 140 character packages of fun and frivolity.<br/><br/>So, if you like seeing pictures of cats dressed up as people, feel free to follow me - there's a button over on the side panel, or you can look me up by my Twitter name @SM_Bradshaw.<br/><br/><br/>
