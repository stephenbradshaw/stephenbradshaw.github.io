It's official.  My own <a href="http://www.soldierx.com/hdb/Stephen-Bradshaw">entry</a> in the <a href="http://www.soldierx.com/hdb">Hackers Database</a> and everything!  <br/><br/>What is the Hackers Database?  From the <a href="http://www.soldierx.com/faq">FAQ</a>:<br/><br/><br/><blockquote class="tr_bq">What is the main goal of the Hacker Database? (Known as the HDB)<br/><br/>The HDB is a community oriented database intended to document hackers, phreakers, and people who have influenced the realm of computer security. One major goal is to get factual documentation concerning people who are in the database. Another goal is to get rumors (unconfirmed possible facts) to be listed in the rumors section of their entry. If there are entries or information that somebody would like to see in the database, feel free to contact me or cisc0ninja with the information and your sources and we will be more than happy to make it a part of the database. If there is information that you need censored (such as your full real name) you will need to contact RaT in order to get those changes made.</blockquote>  <br/><br/><br/>
