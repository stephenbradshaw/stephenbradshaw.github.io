Ive got an article in the latest edition of Pentest Magazine about setting up a pentesting system using Ubuntu Linux.Â  This covers the actual process I use at work when setting up a pentesting box.<br/><br/>Read more about this issue <a href="http://pentestmag.com/pentest-web-app-082012/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/>There were a few bits and pieces I wrote but left out of the article because of space reasons, so I will be posting them here on my blog soonish.<br/><br/>
