I wrote this tutorial on exploiting an SEH based vulnerability in Vulnserver a while back and am just getting around to posting a link for it here now that some formatting issues have been sorted.

Its at the InfoSec Institute site once more (link updated to the Internet Archive cache due to unavailability of original).<br/><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110503013646/http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/seh-exploit/">Link</a><br/><br/><br/>Hopefully the next part in the series will be coming up soon, keep watching this space.
